# Anonymous Housing Quality Assessment

A revolutionary privacy-preserving building quality inspection system powered by Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology, enabling confidential property evaluations on the blockchain.

## üè† Project Overview

The Anonymous Housing Quality Assessment platform addresses the critical need for transparent yet private building quality evaluations in the real estate industry. By leveraging cutting-edge FHE technology, our system enables certified assessors to conduct comprehensive property inspections while maintaining complete privacy of sensitive assessment data.

## üîê Core Concepts

### FHE Contract for Anonymous Housing Quality Assessment

Our smart contract utilizes **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to enable privacy-preserving building quality detection and assessment. This groundbreaking approach allows:

- **Confidential Scoring**: Assessment scores are encrypted and processed without revealing actual values
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics**: Statistical analysis on encrypted data without compromising individual property details
- **Secure Aggregation**: Multiple assessments can be combined while maintaining data confidentiality
- **Transparent Verification**: Assessment validity can be verified without exposing sensitive information

### Privacy Building Quality Detection

The system performs comprehensive building quality analysis across four critical dimensions:

1. **Structural Integrity** - Foundation, walls, and roof evaluation
2. **Safety Systems** - Fire safety, electrical systems, and emergency protocols
3. **Utility Infrastructure** - Plumbing, heating, and electrical installations
4. **Location Quality** - Neighborhood assessment and environmental factors

All evaluations are conducted using encrypted computation, ensuring that raw assessment data remains confidential while still enabling meaningful quality analysis and reporting.
